# Indeed Remote Tracker

This repository contains the data behind the *Indeed Hiring Lab's* Remote Tracker data product. The data is updated monthly, with the exact timing depending upon Hiring Labâ€™s capacity and priorities.

## Methodology

The data in this repository are the share of remote/hybrid job postings, as a percentage of total (remote AND non-remote) job postings, using a seven-day trailing average.

We start by searching if the job location is remote before doing a keyword search on the job posting text to identify remote/hybrid jobs. We then calculate the aggregate share of job postings in a specific location that included keywords associated specifically with remote, hybrid and flexible work arrangements (e.g. "remote work", "flexible work" and "hybrid role"). More information about the data and methodology is available in [an accompanying note](https://www.hiringlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Hybrid-Remote-Methodology.pdf).
